on Debian/Ubuntu based systems (with apt-get) run:

```apt-get install qemu-guest-agent```


on Redhat based systems (with yum):

```yum install qemu-guest-agent```


on SUSE Linux (with zypper):

```zypper install qemu-guest-agent```



Depending on the distribution, the guest agent might not start automatically after the installation.

Start it either directly with

```systemctl start qemu-guest-agent```

Then enable the service to autostart (permanently) if not auto started, with

```systemctl enable qemu-guest-agent```
